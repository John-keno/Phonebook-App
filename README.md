# Phonebook-App

This code is a simple telephone application built using Node.js and JavaScript. It uses the readline module to create a command-line interface for user interaction. The application manages a phonebook with the ability to add, remove, and dial phone numbers. It also supports the concept of "observers" which are objects that get notified when certain events occur in the telephone object.
